## How to set up Better for your organization

Better mirrors your [Github issues](https://github.com/better-feedback/better-app/issues) to a [hosted website](https://better.betterhq.org/), which allows your community to vote on them, fund them as bounties and claim the pooled funds for implementing them. Issues could range from feature requests, to DAO proposals or content marketing ideas.

Setting up your own Better project takes a few steps:

- Fork the [Better repo](https://github.com/better-feedback/better-app)
- Set up [Vercel]([url](https://vercel.com/))
    - Add a new project, linking to your forked repo
     - Set your ENV variables (Ask us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wwwwRFa6aj)!)

After a successful deployment, point your vercel deployment to your custom URL, eg. feedback.yourdapp.com, roadmap.yourdapp.com, bounties.yourdapp.com

- Copy your DNS info at `https://vercel.com/[yourproject]/[yourrepo]/settings/domains`
- Add the info in your domain manager interface

ðŸŽŠ Congratulations, you just deployed your custom Better site ðŸŽ‰
